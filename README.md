## What is SilverFast Ai?
 
SilverFast Ai is a scanning software that works with a wide range of scanners from different manufacturers, such as Canon, Epson, HP, Nikon, and more. It supports both flatbed and film scanners, and can scan in various modes, such as reflective, transparency, or infrared. It also supports different color spaces, such as RGB, CMYK, or Lab.
 
SilverFast Ai is designed to give you full control over your scanning process, allowing you to adjust various parameters and settings to suit your needs and preferences. For example, you can adjust the resolution, bit depth, color balance, exposure, contrast, sharpness, noise reduction, and more. You can also use the software's built-in tools to enhance your scans, such as:
 
- IT8 Calibration: This tool allows you to calibrate your scanner and ensure accurate color reproduction by using a standard color reference chart. SilverFast Ai 6.6.2r5 .31 makes this process fully automated and easy to use.
- Multi-Exposure: This tool allows you to scan your film or slides multiple times with different exposure settings and combine them into one image with increased dynamic range. This means that you can capture more details in both highlights and shadows, resulting in a more realistic and natural-looking image. This feature is only available for scanners that support it.
- NegaFix: This tool allows you to scan your negatives and convert them into positive images with reduced color casts and improved contrast. SilverFast Ai 6.6.2r5 .31 offers new NegaFix profiles that allow for more detailed corrections.
- Selective Color Correction: This tool allows you to selectively adjust the hue, saturation, and brightness of specific colors in your image. You can also create, save, and export presets for use in other SilverFast versions.
- SilverFast Ai-HDR Gamma Optimization: This tool allows you to synchronize your 48-bit scanning between SilverFast Ai / Ai Studio and image editing with SilverFast HDR / HDR Studio. The HDR / HDR Studio independently adopts the gamma settings of your previous scan.

Besides these tools, SilverFast Ai also offers other features that make scanning easier and faster, such as Auto Frame Detection, Batch Scanning, Job Manager, Prescan Concept, Histogram Correction, Clone Tool, Unsharp Masking, Descreening, Dust and Scratch Removal, and more.
